NETSNAIL 0.8

ABOUT

  Netsnail is a simple network proxy that simulates low bandwidth.

RUNNING

Usage of netsnail:
  -d=0: the delay on data transfer in ms
  -i=0: a fixed delay in ms when each connection is made
  -h="localhost": the remote hostname
  -l=9091: the local port of this proxy
  -r=80: the port of the remote host

EXAMPLE

  netsnail -h="www.google.com" -d=1000 -l=8080
  
  This will open the port 8080 on the local machine and forward the traffic to
  www.google.com on port 80 (default). The transfer delay of 1000ms will be
  slept on each data transfer between the local machine and the server in both
  directions.
